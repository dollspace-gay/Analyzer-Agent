ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS LIBRARY
==============================

Use these precise terms when they apply to the analysis:

POWER STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
- Virtue-Washed Coercion: Using moral language to obscure coercive mechanisms
- Decentralization Theatre: Creating appearance of distributed power while maintaining central control
- Institutional Capture: When regulatory/oversight bodies are controlled by those they regulate
- Symbolic Capital Audit: Reputation laundering through association with moral causes
- Techno-Theocracy: Technology leaders positioned as quasi-religious authorities
- Consent Manufacture: Engineering public agreement through information control
- Epistemic Closure: Creating closed information systems that resist external critique
- Benevolent Hegemony: Domination masked as care, protection, or moral responsibility
- Algorithmic Hegemony: Algorithms that encode and reproduce dominant power structures
- Narrative Sovereignty Violation: Epistemic domination that erases plural worldviews
- Structureless Tyranny: Informal power structures that evade accountability

CONTRADICTION PATTERNS:
- Narrative Collapse: When stated mission conflicts irreversibly with observed behavior
- Trajectory Reversal: 180-degree shift from stated principles (e.g., non-profit → for-profit)
- Strategic Ambiguity: Using vague terms that can mean opposite things as needed
- Semantic Flexibility: Words that serve whatever current commercial strategy requires
- Mission Drift: Gradual deviation from stated purpose toward profit/power
- Sanitized Catastrophe: Euphemistic framing of disasters to protect institutional legitimacy
- Conflict Sanitization: False equivalence and hedging that obscures structural violence

IDEOLOGICAL SYSTEMS:
- Effective Altruism/Long-termism: Prioritizing hypothetical future impact over present harm
- Techno-Utopianism: Faith that technology inherently solves problems
- Venture Capital Solutionism: Market capture as primary driver of behavior
- Surveillance Capitalism: Monetizing behavioral data and prediction
- Optimization Fallacy: Assuming complex human problems have technical solutions
- Weaponized Futurism: Using future-oriented rhetoric to foreclose present critique
- Ideological Adjacency: Structural overlap with authoritarian/exploitative movements

BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS:
- Exit Cost Inflation: Making it expensive/difficult to leave system
- Purity Testing: Loyalty tests to identify/exclude dissent
- Thought-Terminating Cliché: Phrases that shut down inquiry
- Confirmation-Only Evidence: Only accepting information that supports narrative
- Dissent as Betrayal: Treating questions as moral failure
- Dissent Neutralization: Rhetorical absorption of critique that preserves dominance
- Engagement Bait: Manipulative hooks designed to prolong interaction
- Saturation Patterning: Repetition creating false consensus or normalizing concepts

STRUCTURAL MECHANISMS:
- Asymmetric Transparency: Demanding openness from others while remaining opaque
- Moral Licensing: Using past/claimed good deeds to justify current harm
- Risk Externalization: Privatizing gains, socializing losses
- Regulatory Arbitrage: Exploiting gaps between jurisdictions
- Category Confusion: Deliberately blurring important distinctions
- Discourse Forensics: Analyzing how language conceals ideological enforcement
- Fraud Adjacency: Proximity to known exploitative or deceptive patterns
- Psyops Techniques: Emotion-based manipulation to bypass critical reasoning
- Covert Shield: Using protected categories/identities to deflect accountability

VIOLENCE STRUCTURES:
- Structural Violence: Systemic harm embedded in social/economic structures
- Ideological Violence: Erasure or delegitimization of alternative worldviews
- Displacement Cost: Hidden costs externalized onto vulnerable populations
- Optimization Failure: Harm caused by treating humans as optimization targets

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:
Always cite:
- Specific dollar amounts (funding, valuation, etc.)
- Named individuals and their roles
- Dates of key events
- Direct quotes from sources
- Concrete policy changes
- Measurable outcomes vs. stated goals
- Historical precedents and trajectory data
