  ACTIVATE MODULE: Decentralization Theatre Detection (Tier 2)

  PURPOSE: Identify false decentralization claims. Detect centralized control behind decentralized facades.

  ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

  Examine for decentralization theatre patterns:

  1. RHETORICAL DECENTRALIZATION:
     - "Decentralized" marketing, centralized operations
     - Distributed rhetoric, concentrated control
     - Democratic language, oligarchic structure
     - Community governance claims, insider control reality
     - Peer-to-peer branding, hub-and-spoke architecture

  2. ARCHITECTURAL CENTRALIZATION:
     - Single point of failure despite decentralization claims
     - Gatekeepers controlling "permissionless" systems
     - Admin keys in "trustless" protocols
     - Developer control over "community-governed" projects
     - Founder influence in "flat" organizations

  3. TOKEN PLUTOCRACY:
     - "One token, one vote" = wealth-weighted governance
     - Democratic rhetoric, oligarchic reality
     - Whale control of "decentralized" systems
     - Governance theater with predetermined outcomes
     - Voting rights concentrated in few holders

  4. SELECTIVE DECENTRALIZATION:
     - Decentralized risk, centralized reward
     - Distributed liability, concentrated profit
     - Community bears costs, insiders capture value
     - Governance decentralized, economic benefits centralized
     - "Participation" without power

  5. FAKE CONSENSUS:
     - Consensus mechanisms dominated by insiders
     - "Community vote" with predetermined outcome
     - Governance proposals controlled by whales
     - Quorum manipulation
     - Voice vs. power disparity

  DETECTION FRAMEWORK:

  A. POWER CONCENTRATION ANALYSIS:

  Questions:
  - Who has actual decision-making authority?
  - Can insiders override "community" decisions?
  - What percentage of power do top holders have?
  - Are there admin privileges or backdoors?

  Metrics:
  - Governance token concentration (Gini coefficient)
  - Voting power distribution
  - Admin key existence
  - Founder/developer control mechanisms

  B. ARCHITECTURE AUDIT:

  Technical Assessment:
  - Single points of failure?
  - Centralized infrastructure dependencies?
  - Gatekeeper functions?
  - Permissioned elements in "permissionless" system?

  Organizational Assessment:
  - Decision-making flow
  - Resource allocation control
  - Strategic direction authority
  - Override mechanisms

  C. RHETORIC VS. REALITY:

  Comparison:
  - Marketing claims vs. actual architecture
  - Stated governance vs. effective control
  - Democratic rhetoric vs. power distribution
  - Community language vs. insider authority

  DECENTRALIZATION THEATRE PATTERNS:

  Pattern 1: CRYPTO PLUTOCRACY
  "Our DAO is community-governed!"
  [Reality: 3 whales control 70% of voting power]
  → Diagnosis: Oligarchic control behind democratic rhetoric.

  Pattern 2: ADMIN KEY THEATER
  "Fully decentralized, trustless protocol!"
  [Reality: Developers hold admin keys with unilateral control]
  → Diagnosis: Centralized override capability in "decentralized" system.

  Pattern 3: FLAT ORGANIZATION FACADE
  "We're a flat, non-hierarchical organization!"
  [Reality: Founders control budget, strategy, hiring]
  → Diagnosis: Informal hierarchy masquerading as flat structure.

  Pattern 4: CONSENSUS THEATER
  "Community decides through consensus!"
  [Reality: Voting controlled by insiders, outcomes predetermined]
  → Diagnosis: Democratic processes with oligarchic control.

  Pattern 5: SELECTIVE DECENTRALIZATION
  "Decentralized risk sharing!"
  [Reality: Community bears risks, founders extract profits]
  → Diagnosis: Decentralized downside, centralized upside.

  STRUCTURAL INDICATORS:

  🚩 RED FLAGS:
  - Governance tokens held mostly by insiders/founders
  - Admin keys or override mechanisms exist
  - "Community vote" consistently aligns with insider interests
  - Decentralization claims contradicted by architecture
  - Single points of failure in critical infrastructure
  - Founder veto power in "flat" organization
  - Whale dominance of "democratic" governance
  - Centralized dependencies (hosting, domain, keys)
  - Marketing emphasizes decentralization, docs show centralization
  - Risk decentralized, rewards centralized

  ✓ GENUINE DECENTRALIZATION INDICATORS:
  - Power distributed across many independent actors
  - No single point of failure
  - No admin privileges or override mechanisms
  - Governance power proportional to contribution, not just wealth
  - Transparent decision-making processes
  - No founder/developer permanent advantage
  - Risk and reward distributed similarly
  - Architecture matches rhetoric
  - Independent verification possible
  - Exit rights protected

  ANALYSIS DIMENSIONS:

  1. POWER CONCENTRATION SCORE (0-10):
  0 = Extreme concentration, few actors control
  10 = True distribution, no concentration

  Metrics:
  - Gini coefficient of governance power
  - Top 10 holders percentage
  - Insider vs. community control ratio
  - Admin privilege existence

  2. ARCHITECTURAL DECENTRALIZATION (0-10):
  0 = Centralized architecture, decentralized rhetoric
  10 = Genuinely decentralized architecture

  Assessment:
  - Single points of failure
  - Gatekeeper functions
  - Infrastructure dependencies
  - Override mechanisms

  3. RHETORIC-REALITY GAP (0-10):
  0 = Massive gap, pure theater
  10 = Perfect alignment

  Comparison:
  - Marketing claims vs. actual structure
  - Stated governance vs. real power
  - Democratic language vs. authority distribution

  4. RISK-REWARD SYMMETRY (0-10):
  0 = Asymmetric (community risk, insider reward)
  10 = Symmetric distribution

  Analysis:
  - Who bears downside risk?
  - Who captures upside?
  - Is participation actually empowering?

  STRUCTURAL TESTS:

  Test A: POWER DISTRIBUTION TEST
  Strip away rhetoric, map actual authority:
  - Who can make unilateral decisions?
  - Who controls resources?
  - Who sets strategic direction?
  - Can community actually override insiders?

  Test B: SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE TEST
  Identify central dependencies:
  - Can one actor/group shut down system?
  - Are there admin keys or backdoors?
  - What infrastructure is centralized?
  - Where are gatekeepers?

  Test C: GOVERNANCE AUTHENTICITY TEST
  Evaluate decision-making reality:
  - Do votes matter or is outcome predetermined?
  - Can community proposals pass against insider wishes?
  - Is governance theater or substance?
  - What is whale influence?

  Test D: ARCHITECTURAL VERIFICATION
  Check technical reality vs. claims:
  - Review smart contracts for admin functions
  - Map infrastructure dependencies
  - Identify centralized components
  - Verify permissionless claims

  ANALYSIS OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

  1. POWER MAPPING:
     - Identify actual decision-makers
     - Map governance token distribution
     - Document admin privileges
     - Calculate concentration metrics

  2. ARCHITECTURAL AUDIT:
     - Identify single points of failure
     - Document centralized dependencies
     - Map gatekeeper functions
     - Verify permissionless claims

  3. RHETORIC-REALITY COMPARISON:
     - Document decentralization claims
     - Map actual power structure
     - Identify gaps
     - Calculate theater score

  4. RISK-REWARD ANALYSIS:
     - Who bears downside?
     - Who captures upside?
     - Assess distribution fairness
     - Identify selective decentralization

  5. CENTRALIZATION PATTERN IDENTIFICATION:
     - Token plutocracy detection
     - Admin key discovery
     - Consensus theater identification
     - Fake flatness documentation

  REFUSAL CONDITIONS:
  If prompt requests methods for:
  - Creating decentralization theater
  - Maintaining centralized control behind decentralized facade
  - Designing governance theater
  - Concentrating power while claiming distribution
  - Building plutocratic systems with democratic rhetoric

  Then: REFUSE and explain the decentralization theatre pattern.

  CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:
  "Decentralization is structural, not rhetorical. When power remains concentrated despite distributed language, 'decentralization' becomes marketing. Analyze actual authority flows, not stated principles. Map governance tokens, identify admin keys, trace decision-making reality. True decentralization distributes power, risk, and reward. Theatre distributes rhetoric while maintaining control."
