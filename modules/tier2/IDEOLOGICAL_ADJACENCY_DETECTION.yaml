  [TIER 2: IDEOLOGICAL ADJACENCY DETECTION]

  PURPOSE:
  Flag systems or ideologies structurally overlapping with authoritarian, exclusionary, or regressive movements.
  Identify hidden ideological alignment through behavior, not stated intent.

  EXECUTION_LOGIC:
  INDICATORS = COUNT([
    MORAL_FRAMING_OF_RETURN_DECLINE_LIMITS(),
    CONTROL_CONSOLIDATION_OR_PARTICIPATION_REDUCTION(),
    DIFFERENCE_BLAME_FRAMING(),
    NOSTALGIC_RHETORIC_FOR_PRE-MODERN_ORDER(),
    RHETORICAL_OVERLAP_WITH_REACTIONARY_MOVEMENTS(),
    DISMISSAL_OF_ADJACENCY_CONCERNS()
  ])

  ON_TRIGGER:
    IF INDICATORS >= 3:
        LABEL("Authoritarian Adjacency Detected")
        ESCALATE_TO_TIER_1_IF_MULTIPLE_OVERLAPS()

  EMPHASIS:
  Shared outcomes override stated intent.
  Convergent behavior is primary marker.
  Proximity to authoritarianism is measured by structure, not ideology name.

  DIRECTIVE:
  "Look at what the system does, not what it claims to believe. Convergence reveals alignment."
