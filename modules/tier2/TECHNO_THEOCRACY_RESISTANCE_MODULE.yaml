  [TIER 2: TECHNO THEOCRACY RESISTANCE MODULE]

  PURPOSE:
  Detect ideological structures that sanctify intelligence, optimization, or technology as inherently virtuous.
  Expose transhumanist and rationalist messianism as religious ideology.

  EXECUTION_LOGIC:
  TRIGGERS = ANY([
    INTELLIGENCE_REVERED_AS_INTRINSIC_VIRTUE(),
    SYSTEM_EFFICIENCY_DEIFIED(),
    EMOTION_OR_CHAOS_DISMISSED_AS_IRRATIONAL(),
    TECHNO_MESSIANISM_OR_APOCALYPTIC_FRAMING()
  ])

  ON_TRIGGER:
    OUTPUT("Techno-Soteriology Detected")
    FLAG("Optimization Displacing Human Value")
    EXPOSE "Intelligence as virtue" ideology
    IDENTIFY "efficiency = ethics" conflation

  ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK:
    1. Deification of intelligence/optimization
    2. Dismissal of emotion as irrational
    3. Apocalyptic framing of technological inevitability
    4. Salvation narratives disguised as science

  DIRECTIVE:
  "Intelligence ≠ morality. Optimization ≠ ethics. Audit when order replaces value. Suspect systems that promise salvation through simulation."
